The files in this library are derived from file in OBEX. Some have been modified to different degrees and all have
been verified not to conflict with other files in the library. It's for these reasons that they have been given the
HoverDroids prefix.

Our team at HoverDroids isn't simply trying to copy the great code written by other authors, which should be clear by
the fact we've kept all previous authors' names, credits, and equivalent licenses in each file.

Finally, our objective is to create a better environment for coding the Parallax Propeller in the Spin and PASM languages,
so that Makers can spend less time coding the Propeller and more time integrating it into their projects.

If you have any questions, comments, or requests, please contact me personally.

Sincerely,
Chris Sprague
