This object features method calls similar to the PBASIC commands for the BASIC Stamp
2 microcontroller, such as high, low, in0 through in15, toggle, and pause.

PUB in(pin) : state
{{Return the state of pin.
If pin is an output, state reflects the
output signal.  If pin is an input, state will be 1 if the voltage
applied to pin is above 1.65 V, or 0 if it is below.}}

''Change pin's output state (high to low or low to high).

''Make the program pause for a certain number of ms.  This applies to
''the cog making the call.  Other cogs will not be affected.
