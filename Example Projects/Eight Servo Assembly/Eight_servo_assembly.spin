''This program demonstrates how to control three RC servomotors by dedicating a cog to output signal pulses using a simple
''assembly program. Once the assembly program is loaded into a new  , it continuously checks the value of the "position1",
''"position2", and "position 3" variables in the main RAM (the values of which code running on any other cogs can change at
''any time) and creates a steady stream of signal pulses with high parts that are equal to the position values times the
''clock period (1/80MHz) in length and low parts that are about 10ms in length. (This low part may need to be changed to 20ms
''depending on the brand of motor being used, but 10ms seems to work fine for Parallax/Futaba Standard Servos and gives a
''quicker response time than 20ms.) With an 80MHz system clock the servo signal's pulse resolution is between 12.5-50ns,
''however, the control circuitry inside most analog servomotors will probably not be able to distinguish between such small
''changes in the signal.
'Notes:
' -To use this in your own Spin code, simply declare "position1", "position2" and "position3" variables as longs, create the
'  "p1", "p2" and "p3" address pointers to store the main Hub RAM locations of "position1", "position2" and "position3"
'  respectively, start the assembly code running in a cog with the "cognew(@ThreeServos,0)" line and copy and paste my DAT
'  section into the DAT section of your own code. Note that you must change the numbers "6", "7" and "8" in the ServoPin1,
'  ServoPin2 and ServoPin3 constant declarations in the assembly code to select pins other than Pins 6,7, and 8 to be the
'  output pins for the three servo signals.
' -If you are using a Parallax/Futaba Standard Servo, the range of signal pulse widths is typically between 0.5-2.25ms, which
'  corresponds to "position" values between 40_000 (full clockwise) and 180_000 (full counterclockwise). In theory, this
'  provides you with 140_000 units of position resolution across the full range of motion. You may need to experiment with
'  changing the "position" values a little to take advantage of the full range of motion for the specific RC servo motor that
'  you are using. However, you must be careful not to force the servo to try to move beyond its mechanical stops.
' -If you find that your propeller chip or servomotors stop working for no apparent reason, it could be that the motors are
'  sending inductive spikes back into the power supply or they are simply drawing too much current and resetting the
'  propeller chip. Adding a large capacitor (e.g.,1000uF) across the power leads of the servo motor or using separate power
'  sources for the propeller chip's 3.3V regulator and the servomotor's power supply will help to fix this.
